Mr Grimes: Is that you, John?
John Smith: Yes, speaking.
Mr Grimes: Tell Mary we shall be late for dinner this evening.
John Smith: I'm afraid I don't understand.
Mr Grimes: Hasn't Mary told you? She invited betty and me to dinner this evening. I said I would be at your house at six o'clock, but the boss wants me to do some extra work. I'll have to stay at the office. I don't know when I shall finish. Oh, and by the way, my wife wants to know if Mary needs any help.
John Smith: I don't know what you're talking about.
Mr Grimes: That is John Smith, isn't it?
John Smith: Yes, I'm John Smith.
Mr Grimes: You are John Smith, the engineer, aren't you?
John Smith: That's right.
Mr Grimes: You work for the Overseas Engineering Company, don't you?
John Smith: No, I don't. I'm John Smith the telephone engineer and I'm repairing your telephone line.
