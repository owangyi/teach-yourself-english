Sam What are you going to do with that vase, Penny?
Penny I'm going to put it on this table, Sam.
Sam Don't do that.
Sam Give it to me.
Penny What are you going to do with it?
Sam I'm going to put it here, in front of the window.
Penny Be careful.
Penny Don't drop it!

Penny Put it here, on this shelf.
Sam There we are!
