Can you make the tea, Sam?
Yes, of course I can, Penny.
Is there any water in this kettle(水壶)?
Yes, there is.
Where's the tea?
It’s over there, behind the teapot.
Can you see it?
I can see the teapot, but I can't see the tea.
There it is!
It's in front of you.
Ah yes, I can see it now.
Where are the cups?
There are some in the cupboard.
Can you find them?
Yes. Here they are.
Hurry up, Sam.
The kettle's boiling.
