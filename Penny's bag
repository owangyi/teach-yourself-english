Is that bag heavy, Penny?
Not very.
Here!
Put it on this chair.
What’s in it?
A piece of cheese.
A loaf of bread.
A bar of soap.
A bar of chocolate.
A bottle of milk.
A pound of sugar.
Half a pound of coffee.
A quarter of a pound of tea.
And a tin of tobacco.
Is that tin of tobacco for me?
Well, it’s certainly not for me!
