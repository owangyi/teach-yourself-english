Where’s Sally, Jack?
She’s in the garden, Jane.
What’s she doing?
She’s sitting under the tree.
Is Tim in the garden, too?
Yes, he is.
He’s climbing the tree.
I beg your pardon?
Who’s climbing the tree.
Tim is.
What about the dog?
The dog’s in the garden, too.
It’s running across the grass.
It’s running after a cat.
